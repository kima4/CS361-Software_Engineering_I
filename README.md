# CS361-Software_Engineering_I
Portfolio project for CS361 at Oregon State University


The main project for this class was a group project, in which each member created their own individual software. Along with the software, each member also created a microservice that provided some sort of functionality that was used by other group members. This project was also an introduction to sprints and the Agile method for software development.


My software for this project was the implemntation of the board game shogi, a chess varient from Japan. My microservice provided the ability to rotate images by a given number of degrees. My software used my microservice as well as a teammate's microservice that acted as a Wikipedia scraper to get information about the game.


Result: 167.5/167.5
